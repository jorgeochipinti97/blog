summary: 'How Neovim, Claude Code, and Anthropic skills changed the way I work.'

I dropped the IDE. It wasn't a purist's whim. It was pragmatism.

Neovim, tmux, and the terminal became my main environment. No distractions, no floating windows, no waiting for a heavy editor to boot. Everything runs where it always should have: in plain text, close to the system.

I never lose control. Every decision in my projects is mine, end to end.

## Claude Code

Then came Claude Code. A CLI that understands context, reads files, executes commands, and writes code. It's not a glorified autocomplete. It's an agent that works with you.

What changed the game were skills. Anthropic designed a system where you can define specific behaviors: how to write posts, how to structure architecture, how to follow standards. The model doesn't guess. It follows precise instructions.

## What I built

I created a set of skills for my workflow. From how I write articles to how I design systems. All documented, all reusable.

That experience is available. It's not theory. It's the environment I use every day.

The jump to terminal wasn't a step back. It was shedding layers I didn't need to get faster to what matters: the code.
